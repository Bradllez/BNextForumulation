Bnext Forumulation Beta
===========

Changing group title backgrounds and avatars is fun!

## Installation
0. You need that "Stylish" thing installed in your browser. [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/) | [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe?hl=en)
1. Make a new userstyle with Stylish.
2. Copypasta this junk (https://raw.github.com/Bradllez/BNextForumulation/master/Style.css) into it and name it Forumulation (or whatever).
4. Below the pastebox, under it should have an "Applies to" menu, specify "URLs on the domain" and enter "bungie.net".
5. Click the save button on the left.
6. Follow the directions located IN the code. It is hidden in */ and /*.
7. ???
8. Profit
